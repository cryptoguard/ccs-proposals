# Summary

Fund the development and creation of a documentation of the [market api](https://github.com/particl/particl-market) v3. 

# Rationale

The API documentation will help anyone to setup a market node and use it, like demarkets.io did with the explorer with v2.

## Key Points

What will be done :

- Give all API functions

- Make a tutorial on how to install / use the market API

# Timeframe

It should takes around 2 weeks. Expected for mid february 2021.

# Donation Target

**Donation target:** 1,200 PART

## Note

- The development of this initiative is already underway.

- If the donation target isnâ€™t reached, it will still be done.

- Donation will help demarkets future funding

# Parties Involved
