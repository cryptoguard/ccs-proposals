# Summary

This proposal requests **35,250 PART** per month from the Particl treasury fund for a period of **6 months**. After this period, the team may submit a new funding request for community vote.

We propose a reduced six-month timeframe, shorter than recent twelve-month proposals. This provides stability for our current projects as we develop new ecosystem revenue streams while giving the community the chance to discuss and propose modifications to the treasury model and coin emission rate.


## Note

This is a summarized version of our extensive proposal available [here](https://particl.news/particl-team-funding-request-5/), which includes our short-to-medium term strategy to generate PART ecosystem revenue and reduce our reliance on the network's treasury model. Please read the full proposal for all details surrounding this funding request.

# Use of Funds

The Particl team operates solely on community-approved donations. Funding in PART is taken directly from the network's treasury to support team operations.

Given the current PART price, **we request 35,250 PART coins per month for 6 months**. This will fund the upcoming development cycle at the current pace and cover various operational expenses, including legal and administrative fees.

If PART prices and liquidity improve, additional funds will be used to grow the team and support marketing, communications, community, and outreach efforts to promote the Particl ecosystem and its dApps.

# Legal Entity

All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed by SoonTM Development Ltd ([SoonTM.io](https://soontm.io), an independent software development company.
